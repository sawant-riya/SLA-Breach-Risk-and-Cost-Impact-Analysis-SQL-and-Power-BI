# SLA-Breach-Risk-Cost-Impact-Analysis-SQL-and-Power-BI

1. Project Title:

   SLA Breach & Cost Impact Analysis

3. Project Overview:
   This project analyzes Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance across large-scale e-commerce order data to identify delivery delays, quantify their financial      impact, and uncover the operational root causes behind SLA breaches. Using SQL and Power BI, the project converts raw transactional data into actionable            insights that help businesses proactively manage delivery risk, reduce delay-related costs, and improve customer experience.
   The analysis focuses not only on how often SLA breaches occur, but where, why, and at what cost, enabling data-driven decision-making for operations, logistics,    and seller management teams.

4. Short Description:
   An end-to-end analytics project that evaluates SLA breach rates, delay duration, and financial impact across product categories, seller states, and time            periods, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for operational monitoring and root-cause analysis.

5. Project Goals:
   •	Measure overall SLA performance and identify breach patterns
   •	Quantify the financial impact of delivery delays
   •	Detect high-risk product categories and seller regions
   •	Enable proactive risk monitoring for emerging problem areas
   •	Translate data insights into actionable operational recommendations

5.Key KPIs Showcased:
  •	Total Orders Analyzed
  •	SLA Breach Rate (%)
  •	SLA Breached Orders (Count)
  •	SLA Variance (%)
  •	Average Delay (Days) for Breached Orders
  •	Total Delay Cost (₹)
  
6. Tools & Technologies:
  •	SQL: Data extraction, joins, aggregations, KPI calculation, SLA breach identification
  •	Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards, slicers, and visual analytics

7.How This Project Helps Businesses:
  •	Operational Risk Reduction: Identifies delivery stages and regions contributing most to SLA failures
  •	Cost Optimization: Highlights high-cost delay drivers to prioritize corrective actions
  •	Proactive Monitoring: Flags emerging high-risk seller states before issues scale
  •	Performance Management: Enables targeted seller and category-level interventions
  •	Decision Support: Converts complex operational data into executive-ready insights
  
8.Business Insights:
  •	Approximately 6.8% of orders breached SLA, with an average delay of 10.6 days, indicating material last-mile delivery inefficiencies
  •	Total delay cost exceeded ₹2.9L, with a small set of product categories contributing disproportionately to cost impact
  •	Certain seller states accounted for a majority of SLA breaches due to a combination of high order volume and elevated breach rates
  •	High delay duration (10+ days) formed the largest share of breached orders, signaling escalation risk rather than minor delivery slips
  •	Emerging low-volume seller states exhibited high SLA risk scores, highlighting the need for early intervention rather than reactive firefighting
